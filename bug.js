This error occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceId` API to get the device's unique identifier.  It sometimes returns `null` or an empty string instead of a valid device ID, particularly on Android devices. This inconsistency leads to unpredictable behavior in applications that rely on a stable, unique device identifier for features like user authentication or data synchronization.
