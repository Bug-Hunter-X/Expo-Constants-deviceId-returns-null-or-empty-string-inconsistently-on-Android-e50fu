# Expo Constants.deviceId Inconsistency on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Constants.deviceId` in Expo inconsistently returns `null` or an empty string on Android devices.  This makes it unreliable for applications that require a stable, unique identifier for user identification or data synchronization.

## Problem
The `Constants.deviceId` API, intended to provide a unique identifier for a device, occasionally returns `null` or an empty string, particularly on Android.  The inconsistency makes it difficult to implement features that depend on a reliable, unique ID.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing fallback mechanisms and potentially exploring alternative approaches to device identification, such as using the `SecureStore` API to generate and store a unique ID if `Constants.deviceId` fails to provide a consistent value.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project on an Android emulator or device.
3. Observe the inconsistent behavior of `Constants.deviceId`.

## Additional Notes
While the problem is mainly apparent on Android, similar behavior might be observed on iOS or other platforms.  This issue highlights the importance of carefully considering device ID retrieval in Expo applications and providing robust fallback mechanisms to ensure application stability and functionality.
